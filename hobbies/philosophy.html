      <h3>Quotes</h3>
      <div class="quote">
        <strong>"I love being wrong because that means in that instant, I learned something new that day.”</strong>
        <br><br> Neil deGrasse Tyson
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <strong>"Not all addictions are rooted in abuse or trauma, but I do believe they can all be traced to painful experience. 
          A hurt is at the centre of all addictive behaviours. It is present in the gambler, the Internet addict, the compulsive shopper and the workaholic. 
          The wound may not be as deep and the ache not as excruciating, and it may even be entirely hidden—but it's there. As we'll see, the effects of early stress 
          or adverse experiences directly shape both the psychology and the neurobiology of addiction in the brain.”</strong>
        <br><br> Gabor Mate, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction

      <div class="quote">
        <strong>"Remember, no one can hurt your feelings without your permission. The simple fact is, offense is taken, not given.”</strong>
        <br><br> Ricky Gervais
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <strong>"To be fair, much of the Bible is not systematically evil but just plain weird, as you would expect of a chaotically cobbled-together 
          anthology of disjointed documents, composed, revised, translated, distorted and 'improved' by hundreds of anonymous authors, editors and copyists, 
          unknown to us and mostly unknown to each other, spanning nine centuries”</strong>
        <br><br> Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <strong>"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."</strong>
        <br><br> often attributed to either Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill or Charles F. Aked
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <strong>"Science works. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we have, 
        self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules.
        First: there are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless. 
        Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised. We must understand the Cosmos as it is and not confuse how it is with how we wish it to be. 
        The obvious is sometimes false; the unexpected is sometimes true.”</strong>
        <br><br> Carl Sagan, Cosmos
